# Everything is Awesome

 The Builders, Lucy and Emmet are lego block enthusiasts. They maintain a webpage that keeps track of block details including block names, materials, colors, manufactured years, and example images. Recently they came into some extra cash and would like to update their app for displaying block details.

Following are the features they would like to implement:
1. Emmet's favorite color is now red, change the functionality of the `Show Blue Legos` button to show red Legos. Be sure to update your code to reflect this change.
1. Lucy would like to display her favorite color of blocks too. Add a button that when clicked will display green Legos.
1. Some bricks have notes. If a brick has notes, include them on the brick detail.
1. Lucy and Emmet would like the brick color names to be all capital letters. Add a `helper function` and invoke it to capitalize the brick name.
1. Dropdowns are all the rage. The Builders would like one added to the nav area to show specific bricks by material.

**Brick Materials:**
Solid, Transparent, Pearl, Chrome, Metallic, Milky, Glitter, Speckle, Ink, Process,
Modulex

1. The Builders' would like a search box that will accept a `LegoId` and display only that Lego. *What will you display if the `LegoId` is not valid? Being able to hit the enter key would be a nice touch too.


### Stretch Goal
If we are able to complete the feature list within budgeted time, the Builders would like to add the option to sort the Legos by the manufactured year; oldest to newest and then back again. Unfortunately, some Legos in the dataset may not have a value. Where do they go? You decide.
